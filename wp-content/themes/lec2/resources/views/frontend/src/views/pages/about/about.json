Already available FPGA technologies, but also new FPGA architectures planned, are aimed at complex, computationally intensive and power-hungry applications of the highest performance.</p><p>These areas of application are especially designed for High-End applications in data centers. However, the need for e.g. data center applications on the European and worldwide market is rather low compared to industrial applications with demand for lower complexities.</p><p>The discrepancy between the supply of High-End FPGAs and low complexity FPGAs with low power consumption -which are still required to a large extent in the industry- is growing ever greater. </p><p>To close the aforementioned gap, Krassin Consulting GmbH has designed a training program together with Lattice Semiconductor Inc. to train and support industrial users specifically in this area. Lattice Semiconductor is the low power programmable leader. </p><p>They solve customer problems across the network, from the edge to the cloud, in the growing communications, computing, industrial, automotive, and consumer markets.</p>",
